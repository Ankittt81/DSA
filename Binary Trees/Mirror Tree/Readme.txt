Given a binary tree, convert the binary tree to its Mirror tree.

Mirror of a Binary Tree T is another Binary Tree M(T) with left and right children of all non-leaf nodes interchanged.     

Examples:

Input: root[] = [1, 2, 3, N, N, 4]
Output: [1, 3, 2, N, 4]
Explanation: 

In the inverted tree, every non-leaf node has its left and right child interchanged.
Input: root[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 3, 2, N, N, 5, 4]
Explanation:

In the inverted tree, every non-leaf node has its left and right child interchanged.
Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 105
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 105

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
