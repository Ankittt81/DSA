Given an array arr[] and an integer k where k is smaller than the size of the array, your task is to find the kth smallest element in the given array.

Follow up: Don't solve it using the inbuilt sort function.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15], k = 3
Output: 7
Explanation: 3rd smallest element in the given array is 7.
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 1, 20, 15], k = 4 
Output: 15
Explanation: 4th smallest element in the given array is 15.
Constraints:
1 <= arr.size <= 106
1<= arr[i] <= 106
1 <= k <= n

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n + max_element)
Auxiliary Space: O(n + max_element)
